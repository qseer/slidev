## Key Theorem

<Theorem type="theorem" title="Convergence Guarantee">

For any $\epsilon > 0$, our algorithm converges to an $\epsilon$-optimal solution in $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2})$ iterations.

</Theorem>

<Theorem type="proof">

The proof follows from the convexity of the loss function and the bounded gradient assumption. See Appendix A for details. $\square$

</Theorem>

## Attention Mechanism

Building on the Transformer architecture !@vaswani2017attention, we propose:

:::theorem{type="definition" title="Efficient Attention"}
Given query $Q$, key $K$, and value $V$ matrices, our efficient attention is:

$$\text{EfficientAttn}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} \odot M\right)V$$

where $M$ is a learnable sparse mask.
