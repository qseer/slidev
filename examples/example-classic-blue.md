## Our Approach

<Theorem type="theorem" title="Convergence Guarantee">

For any learning rate $\eta < \frac{1}{L}$, the gradient descent algorithm converges to a local minimum at rate $O(1/t)$.

</Theorem>

<Theorem type="proof">

By the Lipschitz continuity of the gradient, we have $\|f(x_{t+1}) - f(x_t)\| \leq \frac{L}{2}\|x_{t+1} - x_t\|^2$. $\square$

</Theorem>
