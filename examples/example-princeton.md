## Algorithm Design

<Theorem type="definition" title="Neural Architecture Search">

The process of automating architecture engineering using machine learning techniques.

</Theorem>

<Theorem type="theorem" title="Search Efficiency Bound">

Given search space $\mathcal{A}$ with $|\mathcal{A}| = N$, our method achieves $O(\sqrt{N})$ sample complexity.

</Theorem>

## Previous Approaches

- Random search: slow convergence
- RL-based: high variance
- Gradient-based: local optima

<Block type="danger" title="Limitation">

Requires 1000+ GPU hours for single search.

</Block>

::right::

## Our Approach

- Weight sharing strategy
- Progressive search space
- Early stopping criteria

<Block type="success" title="Efficiency">

Reduces search to under 200 GPU hours.

## ImageNet Classification Accuracy

| Method | Top-1 Acc | GPU Hours | Params |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| NASNet | 82.7% | 48,000 | 88M |
| DARTS | 83.1% | 1,000 | 73M |
| **Ours** | **84.2%** | **196** | **67M** |
| Manual (EfficientNet) | 84.0% | - | 66M |

<Highlight type="success">State-of-the-art with minimal search cost.</Highlight>
