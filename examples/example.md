layout: default
title: Theorem Component
subtitle: Mathematical Statements
---

<!--
COMPONENT: <Theorem>
PURPOSE: Display mathematical theorems with auto-numbering
-->

## Mathematical Theorems

<Theorem type="theorem" title="Pythagorean Theorem">

For a right triangle with legs \(a\) and \(b\), and hypotenuse \(c\), we have:

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

</Theorem>

:::theorem{type="theorem" title="Theorem Name"}
For a right triangle with legs \(a\) and \(b\), and hypotenuse \(c\), we have:

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
:::

<Theorem type="lemma">

All continuous functions on a closed interval are uniformly continuous.

</Theorem>

---
layout: default
title: Definitions and Examples
---

## Definitions and Examples

<Theorem type="definition" title="Limit">

Let the function $f$ be defined on an open interval containing point $a$. If for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that when $0 < |x - a| < \delta$, we have $|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$, then we say $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$.

</Theorem>

<Theorem type="example">

Consider the function $f(x) = x^2$:

- $f(0) = 0$
- $f(1) = 1$
- $f(2) = 4$

</Theorem>

---
layout: default
title: Proof and Note Types
---

## Proof and Note Types

<Theorem type="claim" title="Bounded Sequence">

Every bounded sequence in $\mathbb{R}^n$ has a convergent subsequence.

</Theorem>

<Theorem type="proof">

We prove this by the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. Since the sequence is bounded, it lies within a compact set. By sequential compactness, there exists a convergent subsequence. $\square$

</Theorem>

<Theorem type="note">

This is a fundamental result in real analysis and is essential for proving many convergence theorems.

</Theorem>

---
layout: default
title: Compact Theorem Mode
---

## Compact Mode for Dense Content

<Theorem type="theorem" :compact="true">

For $n \geq 1$, we have $\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.

</Theorem>

<Theorem type="proof" :compact="true">

By induction on $n$. Base case $n=1$ is trivial. Assume true for $n$, then $\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} k = \sum_{k=1}^{n} k + (n+1) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + (n+1) = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$. $\square$

</Theorem>

<Theorem type="corollary" :compact="true">

The sum of the first $n$ positive integers is always a triangular number.

</Theorem>

---
layout: default
title: Custom Numbering
subtitle: Override auto-numbering
---

## Custom Numbering

<Theorem type="theorem" number="3.1" title="Special Case">

Sometimes we need to use specific numbering, such as 3.1 to represent the first theorem in chapter 3.

</Theorem>

<Theorem type="theorem" :autoNumber="false" title="Unnumbered Theorem">

This theorem has no number because `autoNumber={false}` is set.

</Theorem>

---
layout: default
title: Highlight Component
---

<!--
COMPONENT: <Highlight>
TYPES: primary, success, warning, danger, info
-->

## Highlighting Important Content

The <Highlight>key concept</Highlight> here is that you can easily highlight text inline.

Different highlight types:
- <Highlight type="primary">Primary highlight</Highlight> for main concepts
- <Highlight type="success">Success highlight</Highlight> for positive points
- <Highlight type="warning">Warning highlight</Highlight> for cautions
- <Highlight type="danger">Danger highlight</Highlight> for critical items
- <Highlight type="info">Info highlight</Highlight> for general info

This makes your slides more <Highlight type="success">readable</Highlight> and <Highlight type="primary">engaging</Highlight>!

# Part 4: Customization Features

## Font sizing, auto-centering, fit-to-page sizing, and academic citations

---
fontsize:
  body: 20px
  h1: 48px
  h2: 36px
  h3: 28px
---

<!--
FEATURE: Custom font sizes per slide
-->

# This H1 Should Be 48px

## This H2 Should Be 36px

### This H3 Should Be 28px

Notice that even without specifying `layout: default`, this slide:

- Uses the default layout automatically
- Shows the footer with author information
- **Body text is 20px, H1 is 48px, H2 is 36px, H3 is 28px**

This demonstrates that **all fontsize configuration works correctly**!

---
layout: auto-center
title: Auto Center Layout
subtitle: Auto-adjusting font size
---

<!--
LAYOUT: auto-center
PURPOSE: Automatically adjust font size and center vertically
-->

## Auto-Centered Content

This layout automatically:

- Adjusts font size to fit content
- Centers content vertically
- Keeps text left-aligned within the centered block

### Example Use Cases

1. Slides with varying content length
2. Content that needs to "fill" the space
3. Dynamic content from data sources

---
layout: auto-center
---

## Short Content Test

Just a few lines of text.

This should display with a larger font size since there's less content.

---
layout: auto-center
title: Dense Content Test
---

## This Slide Has More Content

- Point 1: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
- Point 2: Consectetur adipiscing elit
- Point 3: Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
- Point 4: Ut labore et dolore magna aliqua
- Point 5: Ut enim ad minim veniam
- Point 6: Quis nostrud exercitation ullamco
- Point 7: Laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat

The font size should automatically decrease to fit all this content while keeping it centered.

---
layout: auto-size
title: Auto Size Layout
subtitle: Default flow with Beamer-style page fitting
autoSizePadding: normal
---

<!--
LAYOUT: auto-size
PURPOSE: Keep the default reading flow while fitting the main matter to the available area
-->

## Auto-Sized Main Matter

This layout keeps the familiar default layout structure, but it scales the main matter to fit the available width and height before overflow occurs.

- Preserves the default header and footer
- Keeps content top-aligned instead of vertically centered
- Scales sparse slides up and dense slides down
- Supports `minFontSize` and `maxFontSize` in frontmatter when you need tighter control

This is useful for theorem-heavy or table-heavy slides that should behave more like a LaTeX Beamer frame.

---
layout: auto-size
title: Auto Size Controls
subtitle: Growth, alignment, and padding presets
autoSizeGrow: false
autoSizeAlign: center
autoSizePadding: compact
minFontSize: 16
---

<!--
LAYOUT: auto-size
PURPOSE: Show the configuration entry points for fit growth, vertical alignment, and inner padding
-->

## Configurable Auto-Sizing

This variant keeps the same layout, but changes how aggressively the content area is used.

- `autoSizeGrow: false` keeps the base size and only shrinks when needed
- `autoSizeAlign: center` vertically centers the main matter in the available area
- `autoSizePadding: compact` reduces inner whitespace to maximize usable space
- `minFontSize` still defines the floor when content gets dense

Use this when you want Beamer-like fitting, but with tighter control over visual rhythm.

---
layout: default
title: Citations
subtitle: Academic Reference Support
---

<!--
FEATURE: Academic citations using BibTeX
- Configure in frontmatter: bibFile, bibStyle
- @citekey for parenthetical citations (Author, Year)
- !@citekey for narrative citations: Author (Year)
- layout: references auto-generates the reference list
-->

subtitle: Standard Markdown Notes
---

<!--
FEATURE: Standard Markdown footnotes
- Use [^key] inline and [^key]: below
- Desktop hover previews the footnote content
- Click the marker to pin the popover
- Set footnoteDisplay: hover-only | notes-only | both to control the rendered mode
-->

## Footnote Examples

Our compact variant remains stable across five random seeds[^stability] and reduces inference cost by 38%[^cost].

The release package also includes prompts, configs, and evaluation scripts for reproducibility[^repro].

[^stability]: Across five random seeds, validation accuracy varied by less than 0.3 percentage points.
[^cost]: Measured on a single RTX 4090 with mixed precision enabled.
[^repro]: In Slidev's interactive view, hover over a footnote marker to preview the note, or click the marker to pin the popover.

---
layout: default
title: Footnotes
subtitle: Hover Preview Only
footnoteDisplay: hover-only
---

<!--
FEATURE: Hide the bottom footnote block and keep only inline preview
-->

## Hover-Only Footnotes

This slide hides the footnote block at the bottom while keeping the inline preview on footnote markers[^hover-only].

[^hover-only]: Use `footnoteDisplay: hover-only` in frontmatter when you want a cleaner slide with preview-only notes.

---
layout: default
title: Footnotes
subtitle: Static Notes Only
footnoteDisplay: notes-only
---

<!--
FEATURE: Keep visible footnotes and disable inline preview / pinning
-->

## Notes-Only Footnotes

This slide keeps classic footnotes at the bottom[^notes-only] and disables hover or click popovers on the inline markers.

[^notes-only]: Use `footnoteDisplay: notes-only` when you want explicit notes on the slide and no floating preview UI.

---
layout: references
---

<!--
LAYOUT: references
PURPOSE: Display bibliography/references

For long reference lists, you can split across multiple pages:
- perPage: Number of references per page
- page: Current page number (1, 2, 3, ...)

Example for page 1:
layout: references
perPage: 3
page: 1

Example for page 2:
layout: references
perPage: 3
page: 2

title: Internal Anchor Target
subtitle: Generic href="#..." Destination
---

<!--
FEATURE: Generic internal anchor target
- Declare a target with heading syntax ## Title {#id}
- Or place a standalone target using ::anchor{#id}
-->

## Appendix-Style Target {#anchor-demo-proof}

This slide is a generic destination for internal `href="#..."` navigation.

Jump here from the earlier link, then use `Back to source` to return to the previous slide position.
